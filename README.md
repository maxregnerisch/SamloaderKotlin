## Usage Guide

### Generating Music
1. **Launch the app** and tap "Generate Music"
2. **Select a genre** from the horizontal list (Electronic, Classical, Jazz, etc.)
3. **Choose instruments** by tapping on them (multiple selection supported)
4. **Adjust tempo** using the slider (60-200 BPM)
5. **Set duration** using the slider (15-180 seconds)
6. **Tap "Generate Music"** and wait for the AI to create your composition
7. **Play the generated music** using the built-in controls
8. **Save to library** if you like the result

### Managing Your Library

2. **Play any saved composition** by tapping the play button
3. **View details** including creation date, genre, and instruments
4. **Delete unwanted tracks** using the delete button
5. **Share compositions** (feature coming soon)

## AI Music Generation Algorithm

The app uses sophisticated algorithms to generate music:

### Genre-Specific Generation
- **Electronic**: Synthesizer-based sounds with electronic beats and bass lines
- **Classical**: Harmonic progressions with piano-like timbres and orchestral elements
- **Jazz**: Swing rhythms with complex chord progressions and walking bass
- **Rock**: Distorted guitar sounds with powerful drum patterns
- **Ambient**: Evolving pad sounds with reverb and atmospheric textures

### Audio Synthesis Techniques
- **Additive Synthesis**: Combining multiple sine waves for rich harmonics
- **Subtractive Synthesis**: Filtering complex waveforms for specific timbres
- **Envelope Shaping**: ADSR envelopes for realistic instrument attacks and decays
- **Rhythm Generation**: Mathematical patterns for genre-appropriate beats

## Future Enhancements
