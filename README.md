## Usage

### Basic Song Generation

1. **Select Genre**: Choose from Pop, Rock, Electronic, Jazz, Classical, etc.
2. **Choose Mood**: Select the emotional tone (Happy, Sad, Energetic, Calm, etc.)
3. **Set Duration**: Specify song length (1-10 minutes)
4. **Add Lyrics** (Optional): Enter lyrics for vocal synthesis
5. **Generate**: Click "Generate Song" to create your music

### Playback & Export

- **Play/Stop**: Control playback with the transport controls
- **Waveform**: View real-time waveform visualization with section markers
- **Mixer**: Adjust individual track volumes and mute/solo tracks
- **Export**: Save your generated music as MP3 or WAV files

- **Song Structure**: View generated song sections and musical information
- **Professional Quality**: High-quality 44.1kHz audio with professional effects

## Architecture Details

### Audio Processing Pipeline

1. **Composition**: AI generates chord progressions, melodies, and song structure
2. **Arrangement**: Selects appropriate instruments based on genre
3. **Synthesis**: Converts musical data to audio using MIDI synthesis
4. **Vocals**: Processes lyrics into singing voice (if provided)
5. **Effects**: Applies reverb, compression, EQ, and mastering
6. **Export**: Encodes final audio to MP3/WAV format

### Music Theory Engine

The composition engine uses advanced music theory algorithms:

- **Scale-based harmony**: Generates chords that fit the selected key and mode
- **Voice leading**: Ensures smooth transitions between chords
- **Melodic contour**: Creates memorable melodies that follow musical principles
- **Rhythmic variation**: Generates appropriate rhythm patterns for each genre
- **Song form**: Structures complete songs with proper sections and transitions
